# MixBro

MixBro is a web-based audio mixing tool that allows users to upload multiple audio files, define specific start and end timestamps for each file, set the order of usage, and generate a single stitched dance audio track.

## Overview

MixBro is designed for creating custom dance mixes by combining selected portions of multiple audio tracks. Users upload their own audio files, specify which segments to use, and MixBro processes these segments to produce one continuous output audio file.

The application works **only with user-uploaded audio** and does not fetch, stream, or extract audio from external platforms such as YouTube or other third-party sources.
